# About the Scripta Compiler

_(( This document is very much a work in progress. ))_

The Scripta compiler translates source text written
in a markup language to an Elm representation of Html.
The markup languages supported are

- L0
- microLaTeX
- XMarkdown

For a very simple use of the Scripta compiler, see
[Scripta-example1](https://jxxcarlson.github.io/scripta-compiler-example1).
For its use in a real web app, see
[Scripta.io](https://scripta.io).   

The compiler
provides interactive, real-time editing with error recovery.
See the [overview](/overview/) for more information.

This project has been partially supported by the 
Simons Foundation.  We thank them for their generosity.
