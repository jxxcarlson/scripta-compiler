# About the Scripta Compiler

_(( This document is very much a work in progress. ))_

The Scripta compiler translates source text written
in a markup language to an Elm representation of Html.
The markup languages supported are

- L0
- microLaTeX
- XMarkdown

See [Scripta.io](https://scripta.io) for a web app that
uses the compiler.   A feature of the compiler
is interactive, real-time editing with error recovery.
See the [overview](/overview/) for more information.

This project has been partially supported by the 
Simons Foundation.  We thank them for their generosity.
