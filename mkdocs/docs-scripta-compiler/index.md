# About the Scripta Compiler

_(( This document is very much a work in progress. ))_

The Scripta compiler translates source text written
in a markup language to an Elm representation of Html.
The markup languages supported are

- L0
- microLaTeX
- XMarkdown

The compiler
provides interactive, real-time editing with error recovery for 
these languages.
See the [introductin](/docs-scripta-compiler/introduction/) and [overview](/docs-scripta-compiler/overview/) for more information.  See also
this [conference talk at Lambda Days](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AE_QzSIsmMI)
for an outline of the error recovery strategy.


For a very simple use of the Scripta compiler without error
recovery, see
[Scripta-example1](https://jxxcarlson.github.io/scripta-compiler-example1).
For its use in a real web app (with error recovery), see
[Scripta.io](https://scripta.io).  Here is 
[documentation for both apps as well as Scripta Desktop](https://jxxcarlson.github.io/docs-scripta-app).


This project has been partially supported by the 
Simons Foundation.  We thank them for their generosity.
