# Scripta Compiler Documentationx   

_(( This document is very much a work in progress. ))_

The Scripta compiler translates source text written
in a markup language to an Elm representation of Html.
The markup languages supported are

- L0
- microLaTeX
- XMarkdown

The compiler
provides interactive, real-time editing with error recovery for 
these languages.



**Demos & Apps**

- [Simple Demo](https://jxxcarlson.github.io/app/scripta-compiler-demo/)
- [Scripta Desktop](https://github.com/jxxcarlson/scripta-tauri/blob/main/README.md)
- [Scripta.io](https://scripta.io)

Scripta.io is an editing, document management, and publishing system.
Scripta Desktop is simple editing app.  Both Scripta Desktop and
Scripta.io make use of error recovery, while the simple demo does not.
