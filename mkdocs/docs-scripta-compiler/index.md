# About the Scripta Compiler

_(( This document is very much a work in progress. ))_

The Scripta compiler translates source text written
in a markup language to an Elm representation of Html.
The markup languages supported are

- L0
- microLaTeX
- XMarkdown

The compiler
provides interactive, real-time editing with error recovery for 
these languages.
