# Synchronization

## Synchronizing Rendered Text to Source Text

The `lineNumber` field of an `ExpressionBlock` is used for 
rendered-text-to-source syncrhonization.  Namely, when the user 
clicks on a piece of rendered
text, the message `SendLineNumber lineNumber` is sent using

```text
sendLineNumberOnClick : Int -> Element.Attribute MarkupMsg
sendLineNumberOnClick lineNumber =
    Events.onClick (SendLineNumber (String.fromInt lineNumber))
```


When the message is handled by the host app and editor, the
corresponding source text is scrolled into view and highlighted.
(NOTE: still quite innacurate).  In both Scripta.io and Scripta Desktop,
the message is passed on to the Codemirror editor, whihc does the
scrolling and highlighting.

**NOTES.**

- There are still some problems stemming from innaccurate
computation of line numbers by the differential parser.  To 
be resolved.

- To get a finer level of detail, we will need to use
something more than the current line numbers.  These
only give information about blocks, namely the
first line of the block.  Can we at least get at
the line number of text within a block?  See 
the section on [Expressions](/docs-scripta-compiler/dataStructures#expressions)

## Synchronizing Source Text to Rendered Text

Although synchronization is carried out by the host
app, we outine the process here.  First, the user
highlights a block of source text, then pressed a button
or key combination to send a message from the editor to
the Elm app.  On the JS side, the editor code 
for this in Codemirror 6 is

```text
attributeChangedCallback(attr, oldVal, newVal) {

         function sendSelectedText(editor, str) {
                     console.log("sendSelectedText (dispatch)", str)
                     const event = new CustomEvent('selected-text', { 'detail': str , 'bubbles':true, 'composed': true});
                     editor.dom.dispatchEvent(event);
                  }
                  
        ...
```

The selected text is handle by

```text
onSelectionChange : Html.Attribute FrontendMsg
onSelectionChange =
    textDecoder
        |> Json.Decode.map SelectedText
        |> Html.Events.on "selected-text"
```

which passes it to the app's (front end) update function 
in clause `SelectedText`:
 
```text
SelectedText selectedText ->
  Frontend.Update.firstSyncLR model selectedText
```

The `firstSyncLR` function searches the syntax tree (forest)
for the given text using


```text
ompiler.ASTTools.matchingIdsInAST selectedText model.editRecord.tree
```

This is possible because one field of the corresponding 
`ExpressionBlock` is the source text from which it was
derived.  Once the id(s) for corresponding elements
of the rendered text are found, they can be scrolled
into view and highlighted.
