import Compiler.Differ exposing (DiffRecord)
import List.Extra


{-| Module `Compiler.DifferForest` is designed to diff lists with an
implicit forest structure (list of trees) defined by a
function `level: p -> Int`. In the resulting `DiffRecord`,
the prefix, suffix, and middle segments all
represent subforests.

To illustrate
the main issue, consider the lists `u` and `v` (below). These
have an indentation structure like an outline for
an article, and so define the structure
of a forest. In the example
below, the leaf `jkl` in the tree with root `def` is
changed to `JKL`.

```text
    u:
    ----
    abc
    def
      ghi
      jkl
      mno
    pqr

    v:
    ----
    abc
    def
      ghi
      JKL
      mno
    pqr
```

In this example the diff record represents the following structure:

```text
    commonPrefix:
    ----
    abc

    middleSegmentInSource:
    ---
    def
      ghi
      jkl
      mno

    middleSegmentInTarget:
    ---
    def
      ghi
      JKL
      mno

    commonSuffix:
    ---
    pqr
```
